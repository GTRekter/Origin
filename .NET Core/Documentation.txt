Code-First has two commands for code based migration:
Add-migration: It will scaffold the next migration for the changes you have made to your domain classes 
Update-database: It will apply pending changes to the database based on latest scaffolding code file you created using "Add-Migration" command

example:
Add-migration -context ApplicationDbContext
Add-migration -context OriginContext
update-database -context ApplicationDbContext
update-database -context OriginContext
